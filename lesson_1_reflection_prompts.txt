How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Compares previous line with changed line next to each other.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Spot errors more quickly than reading through each line of code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - can commit at specific/meaningful points and create versions.  Cons - if something happens between commits or commits are not successful, will lose changes. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Efficiency
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log shows history of commits, git diff shows differences from one commit to another.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can revert back to old versions if something breaks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control and collaboration.
